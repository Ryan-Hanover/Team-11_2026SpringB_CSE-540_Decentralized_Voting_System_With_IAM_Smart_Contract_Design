# CSE540-group11

1. Overview
This project implements a privacy-preserving voter eligibility system on Ethereum. Voters prove they are 18 or older without revealing any personal information. The system achieves this using three technologies working together:

a. Verifiable Credentials (VCs)
 This acts as the digital certification no the persons' elgibility
b. IPFS
 Decentralized storage to reduce computational time and storage of credential data
c. Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)

2. Features
This project implements a two-contract architecture:
  AgeVerificationIssuer — issues cryptographic age credentials to eligible voters
  AgeVerificationVerifier — verifies ZKP-based age proofs and records votes on-chain
Credential metadata is stored on IPFS to keep on-chain storage costs minimal. The system ensures voter privacy, prevents double-voting, and requires no trusted central authority.
