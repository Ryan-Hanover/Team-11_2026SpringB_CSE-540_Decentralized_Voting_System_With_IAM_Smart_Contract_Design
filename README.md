# CSE540-group11
## 1. Overview
This project implements a privacy-preserving voter eligibility system on Ethereum. The system enables the voter to prove that they are 18 or older without revealing unneccessary personal information. This system enables age verification, where the trusted issuer only provides a digital credential and a verifier checks only the age condition. Overall, this decentralized system aims to mitigate the risks associated with centralized systems, such as single points of failure and data breaches.

## 2. Features
This project implements a three-contract architecture:
  ###### DIDRegistry.sol
  Stores holder-controlled DID entries, anchors minimal on-chain data, and logs key events when holder registers or deactivates their DID.
  ###### AgeVerificationIssuer
  Issues and revokes cryptographic age credentials to eligible voters
  ###### AgeVerificationVerifier — verifies ZKP-based age proofs and records votes on-chain
  Verifies if the holder has an active DID and if the issuer can confirm the credential for that DID.


## Run and Test

### Dependencies (Debian/Ubuntu Linux)

**Solidity Smart Contracts**
- Compile and Deploy on Remix IDE
- Solidity ```^0.8.20```

**Kubo IPFS:**
1. `wget https://dist.ipfs.tech/kubo/v0.40.1/kubo_v0.40.1_linux-amd64.tar.gz`
2. `tar -xvzf kubo_v0.40.1_linux-amd64.tar.gz`
3. `cd kubo && sudo bash install.sh`
4. `ipfs init` (first time only)
5. `ipfs daemon`

**Python dependencies:**
```bash
pip install requests web3 eth-abi
```

## Instructions to Test

1. In Remix, deploy `DIDRegistry.sol` first and capture the DID address.

2. Deploy `AgeVerificationIssuer.sol` and copy the contract address shown in the deployed contracts panel.

3. Deploy `AgeVerificationVerifier.sol`, pasting the `AgeVerificationIssuer.sol` address into the constructor field before deploying.

4. With the IPFS daemon running and both contracts deployed, run `info_2_ipfs.py` with the required arguments (May have to make executable first):
```bash
    info_2_ipfs.py --firstName John --lastName Doe --dob 1990-01-01
```

5. In Remix, navigate to the deployed `AgeVerificationIssuer` contract. Call `issueCredential` with the `credentialHash`, `ipfsCID`, and `walletAddress` printed by the script.

6. Navigate to the deployed `AgeVerificationVerifier` contract. Call `verify` with the same `credentialHash` and `ipfsCID`.

7. To generate a signature, navigate to the top of the Deploy panel in Remix. Click the pencil icon next to the account dropdown, paste the `credentialHash` from the script into the message field, and click Sign. Copy the **Signature** value (not the Hash).

8. Paste the signature into the `verify` call alongside the `credentialHash` and `ipfsCID`. Click transact and confirm the result is `true`.
